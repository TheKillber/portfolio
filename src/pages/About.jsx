               Hi there! I'm Juan Sevillano, a fullstack web developer from
               Argentina. I've been working with NodeJs and React for the last
               few years and I specialize in MERN stack (MongoDB as Database,
               Express as backend framework for NodeJs and React). My favorite
               part of programming is when you see that your work makes a
               difference. <br />
               The most crucial aspect of a page is that the user enjoys using
               it and gets the most out of it, which is why one of my objectives
               is to create beautiful and helpful pages. I am motivated by the
               desire to learn and contribute to my knowledge and expertise in
               programming. If you want to discuss my work, please contact me.
               üòÅ.
